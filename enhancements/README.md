# Enhancement Proposal

## Why do we need it?

Enhancement Proposal (EP) is a design document providing information to the community, or describing a new feature for Dex.

We intend EPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features.
This will make it easier for community to describe, track, and look through the history of changes that a going to affect the future development of a product.
